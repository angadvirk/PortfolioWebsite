# Portfolio
Software Engineer Portfolio Website designed and built by me using React and Bootstrap.

**Link:** https://angadvirk.github.io/

## What I Learned:
* Using react-bootstrap in a react application to easily make and style a responsive website.
* Creating a multi-page react app using react router (v6).

## Current To Do:
* Make sure all links (esp. 'Projects' links) work.

## To Do in Future Versions:
* Create a separate Article component and infrastructure instead of the current hardcoded Travel Stories article, so you can create a blog part of the website. 
* Automate API Call to zen quotes once per day to get quote cache for your site, and store it in a json file. Use GitHub Actions for this? CRON?
* Add 'Last Listened To' section for fun (use Spotify API).
* Make skill progress bars animate when scroll position reaches them.
* Create two tabs for 'Skills' section, one for technical skills and one for soft skills.
* Integrate with GitHub API to show interesting information in Project Boxes.
