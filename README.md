# Portfolio
Software Engineer Portfolio Website designed and built by me using React and Bootstrap.

**Link:** https://angadvirk.github.io/

## What I Learned:
* Using react-bootstrap in a react application to easily make and style a responsive website.
* Spotify API integration that pulls data from my Spotify account to display my 'Last Listened To' song.
* Fundamentals of Web Design - color scheme, typography, spacing, structure.
* Various cat facts ðŸ˜‰

## To Do in Future Versions:
* Set up Browser Router properly for GitHub Pages for future expansion of the website with additional routes, etc.
* Find a solution that fixes direct URL entry and hard refreshes but doesn't have the hash in the URL.
* Create a separate Article component and infrastructure instead of the current hardcoded Travel Stories article, so you can create a blog part of the website. 
* Create multiple tabs for 'Skills' section, to show more skills.
* Add neat images or icons for each project in the 'Projects' section.
* Integrate with GitHub API to show interesting information in Project Boxes, like languages used, etc.
Portfolio Website - To Do
* Change footer links to license, thanks, etc. instead of social media links.
* A college coursework section?
* Experiences section similar to http://topherhunt.github.io/resume/
* (The following point is relevant for the Spotify API Backend, which is hosted on Google AppEngine and not visible in this repo) Add expiration timestamp to each entry in db.json so it can smartly refresh?

## Site maintenance checklist
* Put the most up-to-date version of your resume 
* Update skills section
* Check hosting of backend
* Check all API integrations
* Cleanup and comment code
