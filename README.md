# Portfolio
Software Engineer Portfolio Website designed and built by me using React and Bootstrap.

**Link:** https://angadvirk.github.io/

## What I Learned:
* Using react-bootstrap in a react application to easily make and style a responsive website.
* Spotify API integration that pulls data from my Spotify account to display my 'Last Listened To' song.
* Fundamentals of Web Design - color scheme, typography, spacing, structure.
* Various cat facts ðŸ˜‰

## To Do in Future Versions:
* Find a solution that fixes direct URL entry and hard refreshes but doesn't have the hash in the URL.
* Create a separate Article component and infrastructure instead of the current hardcoded Travel Stories article, so you can create a blog part of the website. 
* Create multiple tabs for 'Skills' section, to show more skills.
* Integrate with GitHub API to show interesting information in Project Boxes, like languages used, etc.
